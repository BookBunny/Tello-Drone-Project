- Line Following
- Mapping
- Surveillance
- Swarming **(Still in Progress)**

# Tello Drone Face Tracking Programming

This is a simple project to demonstrate face tracking with the Tello drone using Python and OpenCV. The Tello drone is a lightweight, affordable drone that is perfect for learning how to program drones. By following this guide, you will learn how to track faces with the Tello drone, which can be applied to other types of drones and computer vision projects.
